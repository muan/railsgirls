Rails Girls
===========

This was a repository for demonstrating GitHub Pages live at Rails Girls London workshop on 5 October 2013. :scream:

The lightning talk slide is here: https://speakerdeck.com/muan/github-pages-are-awesome

Guises, to get started with pages, you first need to know there are 2 types of pages.

1. User/Organization page
2. Project page

### User/Organization page

- Content needs to be pushed to **master** branch
- Repository name needs to be **[username].github.io**, i.e., my username is **muan**, so my user page repository should be called **muan.github.io**
- You can only have **one** user/organization page per user/organanization (you can't have  2 repos named the same anyway)
- Your page will be accessible at **[username].github.io**, and obviously **username** will be yours

### Project page

- Content needs to be pushed to **gh-pages** branch
- Repository name can be whatever you want
- You can have as many pages as you want
- Your page will be accessible at **[username].github.io/[repository_name]**

It is so easy, so simple, and pages can do so much more once you understand the basics. Here's some more awesome resources you might like to check out:
